     Forces acting on atoms (cartesian axes, Ry/au):

     atom    1 type  1   force =    -0.00000002   -0.00000033    0.00000004
     atom    2 type  2   force =     0.00000002    0.00000033   -0.00000004

     Total force =     0.000000     Total SCF correction =     0.000001
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values

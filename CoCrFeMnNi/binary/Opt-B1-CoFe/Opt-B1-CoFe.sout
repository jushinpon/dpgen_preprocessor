     Forces acting on atoms (cartesian axes, Ry/au):

     atom    1 type  1   force =     0.00000006    0.00000005    0.00000011
     atom    2 type  2   force =    -0.00000006   -0.00000005   -0.00000011

     Total force =     0.000000     Total SCF correction =     0.000001
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values
